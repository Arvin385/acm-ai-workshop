# acm-ai-workshop
Fall 2025 Workshop on AI for ACM. There are multiple programs in this repo. The first is a basic API for a Gemini LLM. Students will note two major difficulties when using the LLM: 1. The pre-trained model often times gives out-of-date information. 2. Its "memory" is limited to the immediately stated prompt. The others correct for these issues.
